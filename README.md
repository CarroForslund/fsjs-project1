# Random Quote Generator

This is my first Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript project.

The Random Quote Generator display random quotes from an array every 30 seconds, or every time you press a button. All quotes will be randomly displayed once before they can be displayed again. The background will also change to a random color every time the quote changes. The quotes all include quote and source properties. If known, citation and date properties are presented as well.
